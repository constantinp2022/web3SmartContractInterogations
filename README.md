## About The Project

This is a project that shows how to interrogate blockchains using WEB3PY module.

Basic information could be found and print with ease but for information such as mentioned below are computational expensive and should be run once and saved into a local database. This could sometimes could be retrieved using blockchain explorer infrastructure. See script ``` run_harmony_explore_data.py ``` for an example over Harmony.
